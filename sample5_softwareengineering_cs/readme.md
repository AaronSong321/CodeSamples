Code Creation Time: Feburary 2019 - May 2019

This sample is written in C# based on .NET Framework (.NET 4.7.2, ASP.NET, SQL Server).

## Introduction

The advent of the burgeoning informationalization has found its way to the online education services and it has proved that such online services has advantages over conventional instructions and examinations by being both labor-saving and time-efficient. Despite the array of such systems with identical functions, there is hardly an system that covers all the needs and the data and domain hybridity of departments of one institution also unfortunately rules out the probability of a divide-and-conquer solution of department management. This software focuses on solving this problem by providing a new online education system by designing and implementing a universal education service and introduce a solution of business domain division to avoid cross influence of different departments.

## Subsystems and Modules

This sample comes from a software that designs and implements a universal education service, including four subsystems:

- Registration
- Notification
- Lecture
- Exam

. As delimited by the name of the subsystems, the four subsystems cover the most need of an education service. The first two subsystems provide supporting functions such as login, registration and message notification; while the last two provide course creation (CRUD actually), exam creation, question creation, automatic paper generation function and so on.
